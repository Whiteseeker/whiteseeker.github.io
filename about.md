I'm a developper advocate @ Google focusing on mobile gaming.
On my free time I write about indie mobile games that are either forgotten or never discovered.

I also love graphics programming. Years ago I co-founded [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org) and now I can't wait for [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) to be released !

This blog is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and use a custom theme based on the [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) library.
