*This is my personal blog. The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer.*

I'm a developer advocate @ Google focusing on mobile gaming.
On my free time I write about indie mobile games that are either forgotten or never discovered.

I also love graphics programming. Years ago I co-founded [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org){: target="_blank"} and now I can't wait for [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan){: target="_blank"} to be released !

This blog is made thanks to:

 * [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){: target="_blank"} to parse markdown and script the blog generation
 * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/){: target="_blank"} to automate deployment, image conversion, css/html/javascript mignification
 * [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){: target="_blank"} for hosting (blog's repo [here](https://github.com/Whiteseeker/whiteseeker.github.io){: target="_blank"})
 * [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/){: target="_blank"} library for the theme & design
 * [PhotoSwipe](http://photoswipe.com/){: target="_blank"} for the photo gallery
 * [Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/){: target="_blank"} to detect if a browser support webp format or not
 * [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com){: target="_blank"} for registering push notification
 * [App engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/){: target="_blank"} to send push notification (Specially thx to the beloved [Task Queue api](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/go/taskqueue/){: target="_blank"})
