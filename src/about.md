*This is my personal blog. The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer.*

I'm a developer advocate @ Google focusing on mobile gaming.
On my free time I write about indie mobile games that are either forgotten or never discovered.

I also love graphics programming. Years ago I co-founded [opengl-tutorial.org](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org){: target="_blank"}.

This blog is made thanks to:
