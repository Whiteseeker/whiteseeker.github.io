No game this time ! Over the last few weeks I tried to make that website a "PWA". Curious what it is, or how to do it ?<!--more-->

### What's a PWA ?
PWA aim to make a website look and behave like an application. As vague as it is it generally means:

* Have an icon user can click on to launch the app
* Work offline
* Access the same features as an app:
    * Notification to tell you about new stuff going on in the PWA.
    * In App Purchases
    * Access to hardware features: GPS, camera, accelerometer, ...
    * Integration with other app (Sharing through system intent on Android & iOS for instance)

None all of it is figured out yet, but some already works surprisingly well.
Let's check how to get an icon, offline support and push notification.

### Icon

It's easy at least for chrome, read that [blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en). In short it's 5 steps:

* Create a file like **"manifest.json"** (see content below)
* Put a **\<link\> tag** in the \<head\> of **every page of your website** pointing to the manifest:

~~~ xml 
    <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
~~~

* Have a **service worker** registered for your website
* Be served over **HTTPS**
* Visitors must visit your website **at least twice** with **5 minutes or more between the visits**.

Et voila !

<div style="text-align: center;">
  â€‹<a href="/assets/images/pwa/banner.png" onclick="screenshotOnClick(1);return false;" target="_blank">
    <picture>
     <source srcset="/assets/images/pwa/banner_small.png.webp" type="image/webp">
     <img src="/assets/images/pwa/banner_small.png" alt="Screenshot display banner" style="max-width:45%;" class="gameScreenshotSmall">
    </picture>
  </a>
  <a href="/assets/images/pwa/icon.png" onclick="screenshotOnClick(2);return false;" target="_blank">
    <picture>
      <source srcset="/assets/images/pwa/icon_small.png.webp" type="image/webp">
      <img src="/assets/images/pwa/icon_small.png" alt="Screenshot icon homescreen" style="max-width:45%;" class="gameScreenshotSmall">
    </picture>
  </a>
</div>

### Offline support

Offline support is super easy to implement thx to the "service worker". It's just a javascript file in your root directory of your website. When someone visit your website, the service worker is downloaded by the browser, and the browser will trigger some event on it.
You can register on this event and execute code. The events we will start with are :

* install: When ther service worker is first install in your user's browser.
* fetch: When your website try to fetch anything (html file, javascript, image, etc) it'll trigger that event, and you can choose to either fetch the ressource from the cache and fall back on the network or the opposite (network then cache) or ...

Jake Archibald wrote a lifesaver [blogpost](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/) about that. Read it ! It's dense but super easy to read.

### Push notification

Notification are just great. It let you warn your user proactively about new content on your website.
There are 4 (ideally 5) steps to display a notification:

1. Register your user: [blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web)
2. Send them a push from your server: same [blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/push-notifications-on-the-open-web)
3. In your service worker: 
    a. Receiving the push
    b. Cache the url and content the push will display if the user click on it
    c. Finally display the notification from that service worker


For **step 1** the blog post doesn't really explain how to register the token in your backend. In my case I choosed to store it in [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). Why ? Because all it takes is:

~~~ html
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/2.4.2/firebase.js"></script>
<script>
  var myRegistration = new Firebase('https://luminous-inferno-9971.firebaseio.com/pntokens/'+pushNotifToken);
  myRegistration.set({platform: "chrome", time_offset: timeOffset, token: pushNotifToken});
</script>
~~~

And that's it ! Really, no lies, no hidden error catch, no anything ...
So now that you have a token store server side let's see how to send a push.

For **step 3a**, in your service worker you just register to that event:

~~~ javascript
    self.addEventListener('push', function(event) {  
      console.log('Received a push message', event);
      // Now fetch the payload of the push from your server (title, body, url, ...)
    }
~~~

And that's it !

For **step 3b**, caching the url it's also super easy:

~~~ javascript
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(function(cache) {
      return fetch(notifurl).then(function(response) {
        cache.put(notifurl, response.clone());
        return response.json();
      });
    });
~~~

And finally for **step 3c**, displaying the notification:

~~~ javascript
    return self.registration.showNotification(title, {  
      body: body,  
      icon: icon,  
      tag: tag,
      requireInteraction: true
    });
~~~

You can see these 3 steps put together [here](https://github.com/Whiteseeker/whiteseeker.github.io/blob/source/src/scripts/service-worker.js#L26).
And that's it ! Now go make a PWA of your blog / website !
