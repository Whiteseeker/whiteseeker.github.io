*The Quest Keeper* is *THE* cross over between a **dungeon crawler** and [Crossy Road](https://youtu.be/a3pTw0jmxlg){: target="_blank"}. You play an adventurer trying to complete given by... The Quest Kepper (^_^) and bringing you in various dangerous places full of dangerous stuff: fire, spiders, traps, flying axes, dead archers, etc. <!--more-->

Gameplay is really cool ! It's not as repetitive as crossy road because you have a real goal, and more variation in the element of gameplay. And it's also very challenging and you can feel the learning give very quickly: the first 10 play you might die quickly but after 50 try it won't look so hard anymore. Each quest you complete give you an artifact, and you'll soon want to get them all because they make you more resistant and... well, we all want to collect all the artifact anyway!

As you can see it has a retro/voxel kind of graphism which is pleasant and is easy to "read" so you can analytse the map quickly to find your path. You can totally play without the music it's not useful for the gameplay (and you won't miss it (*^.^*)).
The game also has some options: choising your view angle, a 30/60 fps toggle, and 2 graphics configurations to run on most mobile phones.

If Aladdin's Genie gave me **3 wishes** they would be:

 * **Please add one global leaderboard** (^_^) One quest is infinite and I wish I knew how far I can go compared to the other !
 * **And some achievements** ! There are plenty of stuff to collect there, and many players *love* collecting achievements !
 * **And also cloud saving** ! Many players have multiple devices and many players change device. Starting over on a new phones isn't enjoyable.

The Quest Keeper is **free to install**, has some ads but nothing too annoying and you can **remove the ads with an IAP[^1] of 2€**.
