Tiny Guardians is a surprising strategy game where your role is to protect one enchantress, Lunalie, as she journeys in search of the Sorceress.<!--more-->

Taking some elements of tower defense gameplay, it twist them in a very refreshing way. Instead of protecting a fix point, as in a classic tower defense game, you protect Lunalie as she slowly travel through the map. And instead of building tower you choose the heroes that will protect her. You can choose from 12 different classes of heroes: knight, archer, cleric, assassins, etc. Each heroes has 4 upgrade, giving you plenty of different strategy to finish each level.

The gorgeous art style transport you across 14 different levels having a Story and Challenge Mode, each with three difficulties. Collecting every achievements require quite a lot of investment and will provide you with hours of gameplay.

Tiny guardians was made by Kurechii, a Malaysian independent game studio founded in 2009, and now employ 4 persons. Tiny Guardians is a paymium title, it means that you pay to purchase the game and then the game offer some optional in-app-purchases. It may sound bad but actually these in app purchases are not at all necessary to completely finish the game in a reasonable amount of time. They are mostly there to unlock different esthetic outfits for each hero. So be reassured, you'll not need to spend any additional money after purchasing the game.
