Cards and Castles is a fresh mix of Trading Card Game & turn-based strategy game. Lately I haven't been a fan of all the clones of Magic the Gathering that popped up lately on mobile apart from Hearthstone! But Cards and Castles get me intrigued, and pleasantly surprised.<!--more-->

In C&C you play your cards to create units on a battlefield, or influence them with buff and debuff. Unlike most TCG game, the battlefield is a grid with lots of cells (5*9). Consequently choosing your deck is only one part of the strategy: using your units properly on the battlefield is at least as important. You'll have to position them, calculate range etc, guess the opponent next move & cards, prepare for area damage, etc. The game has 5 different factions: Vikings, Crusaders, Pirates, Warlocks and Ninjas. Each deck can mix together 2 factions, or just use one faction, as you prefer. The difference between factions and the variety of cards available give you a lot of freedom to create synergy in your deck, and offer a deep gameplay.

C&C has a single player mode, but, as for most TCG, all the fun really start when you compete against real players. You'll have quests, monthly reward for ranked game (custom skin ...). Game is really well balanced and devs are very close from the community, listening to feedback and reacting very quickly. The game also have frequent update with new content.

Monetisation is done through pack of cards you can either purchase with real money or with the in game virtual currency (roughly one pack of card every 3-4 multiplayer game depending on quest and victory ratio (^_^) ). However to get the most rare cards you'll be likely to spend money, and the cards you get are random, with no way to exchange between players. Unlike hearthstone you can't craft the specific card you need.

Cards and Castles is made by Bit Mass, an indie studio of 5 game developers based in San Diego. 
Oh and BTW the game is cross platform Android, iOS and PC (steam).
