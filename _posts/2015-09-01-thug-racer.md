Thug Racer bring *Out Run* on Android! Driving a sport car, escaping the cops, time limit ... One really cool indie game with retro graphics!<!--more-->

As many good game it's easy to learn and hard to master. Super simple controls: turn left, turn right and brake. An easy goal: complete 5 stages as quickly as possible. But completing that goal require a lot of practise and skills to avoid other cars, escape police patrols and avoid crashing in the walls.

Monetisation is really good: you can play the game in arcade mode (the main one) for free,with some ads from time to time at the end of a run. You can also do a one time purchase to get a new golden skin on your car, get access to the endless mode, remove the ads, and also help an indie!

Thug Racer is made by Super Coockie Games, two indie game developers from London: Dan and James
